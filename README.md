  ## **Description**
   
  - shop-shop is a full MERN stack mock ecommerce website where users can create accounts, place mock orders, and interact with the store's inventory! 
  - While building this site, I honed my familiarity with REACT and integrating Redux-like technologies (context-API) to manage a global state. Also, while building this site, I practiced deploying payment methods to a MERN application.
