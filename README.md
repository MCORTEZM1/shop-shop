  ## **Live Heroku Application**

  - https://shop-till-u-drop.herokuapp.com/

  ## **Description**
   
  - NeoTech News Blog is a CMS-style blog site where users can create an account to create posts and comment on posted articles. The site makes it easy for users to stay up-to-date with the latest technological news!
  - This application was written using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ES6, bootstrap, Node, Express.js, SQL, Heroku, and is optimized for desktop and mobile
  - The motivation behind NeoTech Blog was the need to stay up-to-date with current tech news and converse with other's who are interested in the same topics.
  - While building this site, I honed my familiarity with SQL databases using full Javascript and creating applications following the Model-View-Controller paradigm. 
  - NeoTech is my first endeavor to develop a full-stack application alone. :nerd_face:
  - Please let me know what you think :smile:
